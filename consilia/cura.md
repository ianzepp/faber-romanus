# Cura - Resource Management

## Overview

Automatic resource cleanup via scoped ownership. Any resource that needs cleanup — file handles, database connections, network sockets, locks — can be managed with `cura`.

## Etymology

- `cura` - "care, concern, attention" — care for a resource within scope
- `curator` - "one who cares for" — interface for managed resources
- `solve` - "release, free" — cleanup action

---

## Basic Pattern

```
cura <acquire> fit <binding> {
    <use binding>
}
// automatically cleaned up
```

**Reads as:** "Care for [resource] as [name] { use it }"

---

## Examples

### File Descriptor

```
cura aperi "data.bin" fit fd {
    fixum data = lege fd, 1024
    process(data)
}
// fd closed
```

### Database Connection

```
cura connect(db_url) fit conn {
    fixum users = conn.query("SELECT * FROM users")
    redde users
}
// conn closed
```

### Transaction

```
cura conn.transaction() fit tx {
    tx.insert(record)
    tx.commit()
}
// tx rolled back if not committed
```

### Network Socket

```
cura socket("localhost", 8080) fit sock {
    sock.mitte(request)
    fixum response = sock.accipe()
}
// sock closed
```

### Lock / Mutex

```
cura mutex.lock() fit guard {
    shared_counter += 1
}
// lock released
```

### Nested Resources

```
cura aperi "input.txt" fit input {
    cura aperi "output.txt", { modus: "w" } fit output {
        pro linea in lege input ut lineae {
            inscribe output, process(linea)
        }
    }
    // output closed
}
// input closed
```

## Error Handling

Cleanup runs even on error:

```
cura aperi "data.bin" fit fd {
    riskyOperation(fd)
} cape err {
    mone "Operation failed:", err
}
// fd still closed
```

Errors during cleanup itself:

```
cura acquire() fit resource {
    use(resource)
} cape err {
    // err could be from use() OR from cleanup
    mone "Error:", err
}
```

---

## The Curator Interface

Resources implement the `curator` interface:

```
pactum curator {
    functio solve() -> vacuum    // cleanup action
}
```

**Etymology:** `solve` = "release, free"

### Built-in Curators

| Type | `solve` action |
|------|----------------|
| File descriptor | Close file |
| DB connection | Disconnect |
| Transaction | Rollback (if not committed) |
| Socket | Close connection |
| Lock | Release lock |
| Arena/allocator | Free memory |

### Custom Curator

```
genus TempFile implet curator {
    privatum path: textus

    functio solve() {
        dele(ego.path)
    }
}

cura TempFile.create() fit tmp {
    inscribe tmp.path, data
}
// temp file deleted
```

---

## Async Resources

`cura` works with async acquisition:

```
cura cede connect(db_url) fit conn {
    fixum result = cede conn.query(sql)
}
// conn closed
```

Cleanup is always sync (no `cede` in `solve`). Async cleanup would complicate the model and create ordering issues.

---

## Target Mappings

### TypeScript

Uses explicit try/finally:

```typescript
const fd = await open("data.bin");
try {
    const data = await read(fd, 1024);
    process(data);
} finally {
    await fd.close();
}
```

Or with `using` (Stage 3 proposal / TypeScript 5.2+):

```typescript
await using fd = await open("data.bin");
const data = await read(fd, 1024);
process(data);
// auto-disposed
```

### Python

Maps to `with` statement:

```python
with open("data.bin") as fd:
    data = fd.read(1024)
    process(data)
# fd closed
```

### Rust

Maps to RAII / Drop:

```rust
{
    let fd = File::open("data.bin")?;
    let data = read(&fd, 1024)?;
    process(data);
}
// fd dropped, closed
```

Or explicit scope with arena:

```rust
let fd = File::open("data.bin")?;
// ... use fd ...
drop(fd);  // explicit cleanup
```

### Zig

Maps to `defer`:

```zig
const fd = try std.fs.cwd().openFile("data.bin", .{});
defer fd.close();

const data = try fd.read(buffer);
process(data);
// fd closed on scope exit
```

---

## Design Decisions

### Why `cura` over `cum`?

`cum` (with) was overloaded for multiple purposes. `cura` is dedicated to resource management and reads naturally: "care for this resource."

### Why `solve` for cleanup?

`solve` means "release, free" — fitting for releasing resources. Alternatives considered:
- `claude` — already used for file close
- `purga` — "clean" feels like scrubbing, not releasing
- `libera` — "free" works but `solve` is shorter

### Why interface-based?

The `curator` interface allows any type to be managed with `cura`. This is more flexible than hardcoding specific resource types.

### Why sync-only cleanup?

Async cleanup creates ordering problems:
- What if cleanup awaits something that fails?
- Nested async cleanup order is undefined
- Most resources have sync close anyway

If async cleanup is truly needed, do it explicitly before scope exit.

### Error during cleanup?

If `solve()` fails, the error propagates. The resource may be in an undefined state. This matches Rust's Drop behavior (panics on drop failure are usually fatal).
